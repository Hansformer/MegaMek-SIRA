Name: William Herrington
Gender: Male
Age: 24

Mercenary employed by SIRA Inc.

A disillusioned young soldier, William deserted from the Draconis Combine after multiple raids against civilians and the slaughter of what he saw as civilian convoys. A fugitive from the Combine, William found meager work in ragtag mercenary outfits, using his skills as long range support to pin enemies down and provide artillery fire for friendly forces. William has found himself employed by SIRA Inc, piloting a Catapult in SIRA's Beta lance to provide fire support. Still green and wanting to prove himself to his fellow Mechwarriors, William is eager and energetic in battle, however, he can get extremely shaken when put into the frontlines, still unsure of his abilities in head-to-head 'mech combat.
